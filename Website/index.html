            <p id="AboutWhatIs">
                Not a Tourist is a project I am building as I travel the world. The goal of it is to learn how to not be every other tourist when you go to a new foreign country. These guides will be geared towards being mindful of why you are visiting not only the country but the places you visit in the country. Mindfulness is a state in which you focus on being intensely aware of what you're feeling in the moment without interpretation or judgement. So, when we visit a country for any reason our goal should be to act in line with those reasons. Our goal is to immerse ourselves into the culture of the country we visit without judgement or interpretation.

            <p id="HowDoes">
                Not Just a Tourist will be guided by my experiences in the country. The guide will be reccomended a minimum of 2 weeks stay to get to experience a good portion of the area or country you visit. I will explain how to be mindful when choosing from the guide for your journey while giving my reccomended places to visit and there will be a little bit of everything because they goal of this is to experience the entire culture but making sure we are not judging or interpreting things different then how they are.
